  Project: Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering


🔹 Introduction

Customer segmentation is one of the most widely used applications of unsupervised machine learning in business and marketing. The objective of this project is to apply K-Means clustering to group customers into distinct segments based on their purchasing behavior and demographic attributes. These segments help businesses better understand their customer base and design targeted marketing strategies.

🔹 Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about customers, typically including:
CustomerID – Unique identifier for each customer
Age – Age of the customer
Annual Income – Income level of the customer
Spending Score – Score assigned based on spending habits
For segmentation, we mainly focus on Annual Income and Spending Score, since these two features provide meaningful insights into customer purchasing patterns.

🔹 Methodology

Importing Libraries
Used pandas, numpy for data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for visualization, and sklearn for clustering.

Loading and Exploring the Dataset

The dataset was loaded and explored using .head(), .info(), and .describe() functions.

Checked for missing values and basic data distributions.

Feature Selection
Selected important attributes like Annual Income and Spending Score for clustering.

Data Visualization
Plotted distributions and scatterplots to understand customer spread across income and spending dimensions.

Finding Optimal Clusters (Elbow Method)
The Elbow Method was used to determine the optimal number of clusters by plotting WCSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares) against the number of clusters.
The “elbow point” was identified as the best cluster number.

Applying K-Means Clustering
Implemented the K-Means algorithm with the chosen number of clusters.
Assigned each customer to a cluster.

Visualizing Clusters
Plotted the clusters in 2D space (Income vs Spending Score) with distinct colors to interpret the segmentation results.

🔹 Results and Insights

The customers were successfully grouped into distinct clusters such as:
High Income – High Spending (premium customers)
High Income – Low Spending (savers)
Low Income – High Spending (potentially impulsive spenders)
Low Income – Low Spending (budget-conscious customers)

These insights help businesses to:
Identify valuable customer groups
Create targeted marketing campaigns
Improve customer relationship management

🔹 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how K-Means clustering can be applied for customer segmentation. By analyzing attributes like income and spending score, businesses can identify meaningful customer groups and tailor their strategies accordingly. The approach provides a foundation for data-driven decision-making in marketing and customer relationship management.
